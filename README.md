# Kodor_Chahin_ChatApp
All the files containing what went into this project.

As I read the requirements for the project, I decided to use php for the front end, and mysql for the backend.
I chose these because these are what I have some backgorund knowledge in, and the three days I had to do this did
not permit me to take the time to learn another language.

The backend was the easy part: I created a database with one table (users) and inserted two dummy values into the table.

The front end was the troubling part: After reading up a bunch of tutorials, and watching videos, I was able to make 
a user login and authentication with a chat box, but the box was not functional. Users Can also log out.

Upon research, I discovered I need Jquery, and Ajax to complete the app, two programs I am very unfamiliar with, and the time alotted 
was not enough for me to get to learn them both.

The biggest issue with this project for me was just the time, If I had a week instead of three days, I feel I certainly would 
have been able to do much more.

I have learned quite a bit from this project, and I am very happy with what I have learned, and this project has tought me that I have so much more to learn. I am much more familiar with php/mysql interactions now and I feel I have learned more from this three day project than a month at school. 

If you have any questions requarding my process, I'll be happy to answer them for you. I posted everything after I had finished which is why I only have one commit per file.

Thanks for the great learning experience!
