# Kodor_Chahin_ChatApp
All the files containing what went into this project.

As I read the requirements for the project, I decided to use php for the front end, and mysql for the backend.
I chose these because these are what I have some backgorund knowledge in, and the three days I had to do this did
not permit me to take the time to learn another language.

The backend was the easy part: I created a database with one table (users) and inserted two dummy values into the table.

The front end was the troubling part: After reading up a bunch of tutorials, and watching videos, I was able to make 
a user login and authentication with a chat box, but the box was not functional. Users Can also log out.

Upon research, I discovered I need Jquery, and Ajax to complete the app, two programs I am very unfamiliar with, and the time alotted 
was not enough for me to get to learn them both.
